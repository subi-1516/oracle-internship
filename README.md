1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

	1.1 Background / Motivation
		The exponential increase in SMS usage has led to a surge in spam messages, affecting user experience, causing fraudulent activities, and posing security threats. Spam detection plays a critical role in ensuring that users receive only relevant messages, thereby improving their overall experience and safety.

	1.2 Scope
		The project focuses exclusively on SMS messages, categorizing them into two binary classes: "spam" and "ham". It does not cover other forms of communication or multi-class spam detection.

	1.3 High-level Description
		The project aims to build a predictive model that classifies SMS messages as either spam or ham. The system will include a user interface (UI) for user interaction, along with a processing pipeline that integrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction.

	1.4 Dataset / Data Source Summary
		The dataset used for this project comprises labeled SMS messages, with a balanced distribution of spam and ham texts, sourced from a public repository.


2. OBJECTIVES & PROBLEM STATEMENT

	2.1 Problem Statement
		The primary problem addressed in this project is the classification of SMS messages as spam or ham. The challenges include dealing with short text, informal language, slang, typographical errors, and class imbalance.

	2.2 Objectives
		The project aims to achieve the following specific goals:
•	Build a predictive model achieving high precision and recall in spam detection.
•	Experiment with various machine learning algorithms.
•	Effectively preprocess and clean SMS text data.
•	Develop an inference pipeline or user interface for classifying new SMS messages.
•	Evaluate and compare model performance metrics.
•	Document findings and suggest possible improvements for future iterations.

 

3. PROPOSED SOLUTION

	3.1 Approach / Methodology
		The project utilizes supervised learning techniques, leveraging text features extracted from the SMS messages. Different models, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM, are compared to identify the best-performing algorithm.

	3.2 Pipeline Overview
		The overall pipeline consists of the following stages:
•	Raw SMS input
•	Preprocessing (cleaning the text)
•	Feature extraction (transforming text into numerical features)
•	Model training
•	Prediction output

	3.3 Justification of Choices
		The choice of preprocessing techniques is driven by the need to clean the SMS text effectively, while models were selected based on their performance on text classification tasks and their interpretability.

	8.1 Program code:

# Simple SMS Spam Detection using Naive Bayes
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score


# 1. Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('spam.csv', encoding='latin-1')[['v1', 'v2']]
df.columns = ['label', 'message']

# 2. Encode labels: ham = 0, spam = 1
df['label'] = df['label'].map({'ham': 0, 'spam': 1})

# 3. Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['message'], df['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 4. Convert text to TF-IDF features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# 5. Train Naive Bayes model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)


# 6. Evaluate model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# 7. Predict new SMS
def predict_sms(text):
    text_vec = vectorizer.transform([text])
    pred = model.predict(text_vec)[0]
    return "Spam" if pred == 1 else "Ham"

# Example
print(predict_sms("Congratulations! You've won a free ticket. Call now!"))
